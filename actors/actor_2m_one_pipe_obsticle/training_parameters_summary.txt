=== POSITION-TO-POSITION SPECIFIC PARAMETERS ===
Target Position: (2, 0, 0)
Target Radius: 0.1 (from reward_position_to_position_hover_like definition)
Velocity Reward Scale: 0.5 (from reward_position_to_position_hover_like definition)
Use Target Progress: false (from reward_position_to_position_hover_like definition)
=== REWARD FUNCTION FORMULA ===
Reward = -scale × weighted_cost + constant (if non-negative: max(result, 0))
Weighted Cost = Σ(weight_i × cost_i²) for each state component

Components:
  - position_cost² = x² + y² + z²
  - orientation_cost = 1 - w² (where w is quaternion real part)
  - linear_velocity_cost² = vx² + vy² + vz²
  - angular_velocity_cost² = ωx² + ωy² + ωz²
  - linear_acceleration_cost² = Δv² / dt²
  - angular_acceleration_cost² = Δω² / dt²
  - action_cost² = Σ(action_i - baseline)²

=== REWARD FUNCTION INTERPRETATION ===
Higher position/orientation weights → stronger penalty for deviation from target
Higher velocity weights → encourages slower, more controlled motion
Higher acceleration weights → encourages smoother trajectories
Higher action penalty → smoother control inputs, less aggressive maneuvers
Scale factor → affects overall reward magnitude and learning sensitivity
Constant → provides baseline reward, encourages survival
Termination penalty → strong negative reward for crashes/failures
